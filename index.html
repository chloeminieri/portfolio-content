            <div class = "section2"><p>Assistive technology is any application, equipment, software, or product that is created to help people with disabilities perform functions that would be difficult or impossible to do independently.</p><p>According to the Assistive Technology Industry Association, assistive technology exists in a variety of forms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low tech: communication boards made of cardboard or fuzzy felt</li>
                <li>High tech: special purpose computers</li>
                <li>Hardware: prosthetics, mounting systems, and positioning devices</li>
                <li>Computer Hardware: special switches, keyboards, and pointing devices</li>
                <li>Computer Software: screen readers and communication programs</li>
                <li>Learning materials and curriculum aids</li>
                <li>And much more: electronic devices, wheelchairs, walkers, power lifts, eye-gaze and head trackers, etc. </li>
            </ul></div>

            <div class = "section3"> <p>With the variety of available assistive technologies, a diverse group of people with disabilities are benefitted. These include (but are not limited to) visual impairment & blindness, Autism spectrum disorders, mobility impairment, deafness, and more. </p> <p>While the opportunities to help are endless, this website focuses specifically on how assistive technology benefits those with speech and language disorders. Communication is a key component of our world; assistive technology has successfully changed the future for people with speech and language disorders due to the development of tools that allow for independent communication.</p></div>
