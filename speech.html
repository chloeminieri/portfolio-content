        <h1>Speech and Language Disorders</h1>
        <p>Speech and language disorders impact the way that people communicate. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) defines speech as “how we say sounds and words. People with speech problems may not say sounds clearly, have a hoarse or raspy voice, or repeat sounds when speaking”. ASHA defines language as “the words we use to share ideas and get what we want. A person with a language disorder may have problems understanding or talking”. Motor speech impairment is one example, where the muscles in the mouth (face, tongue, or larynx) are hard to control and make speech difficult or impossible in severe cases. </p>
        <p>Augmented and Alternative Communication (AAC) defines all forms of communication except for talking. For children or adults who have trouble speaking verbally, they can use AAC to conversate with others. The term augmented refers to adding to an individual’s speech, and alternative alludes to using another form of communication instead of speech. Augmented and Alternative Communication is not restricted to those who need it as a permanent solution; people who undergo surgeries or other experiences that hinder their ability to talk may need these solutions temporarily during the healing process. AAC can be as simple as using gestures or drawings, to as high-tech as iPad apps for non-verbal assistive communication or Speech Generating Devices.</p>
