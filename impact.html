This type of assistive technology is life-changing: children and adults who were stuck with no way to communicate are able to utilize these devices and express themselves clearly.</p>

            <p>The C.A.M.P. Program is a week long speech and language enrichment program. The C.A.M.P. stands for Communicate, Articulate, Make Friends and Play. According to the Speech in Motion C.A.M.P. website, "The C.A.M.P. Program is made to feel like summer camp, however there is a strong focus on speech and language skill development.  Three individualized speech or language goals are selected for each participant, based on their needs.  The goals are targeted throughout the week, providing hundreds of opportunities for practice across activities. There is a strong focus on peer interactions and pragmatic language skills built into the program."</p>

            <p>My sister, Madison Minieri, volunteered at Camp Speech Language Pathology in Motion for the summer of 2022 where she shadowed a speech pathologist. She worked with a 13-year-old boy who has cerebral palsy and dysarthria, which affects the muscles of his mouth and impairs his ability to speak. The assistive communication tablet gave this boy the ability to communicate. Speech and language are powerful and amazing forms of expression; it is incredible that technology can give people this chance. </p>

            <p>“Working at Speech Language Pathology in Motion C.A.M.P. was an amazing experience. I gained a lot of experience with assistive devices, especially with one young boy who has an AAC device which has all of the words and phrases he commonly needs. They are programmed right into the device and includes general categories such as ‘About Me’, ‘Questions’, and ‘Places’. It also has fun categories that he loves, like his ‘Jokes’ section that he uses to share jokes with everyone! In order to navigate the tablet, he has a scrolling button and a selection button attached to his wheelchair.” - Madison Minieri</p>
