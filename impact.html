        <h1>Meaningful Impact</h1>
        <p>Speech-Generating Devices allow for effective communication and provide people with the opportunity to express themselves. This type of assistive technology is life-changing: children and adults who were stuck with no way to communicate are able to utilize these devices and express themselves clearly.</p>

        <h2>A Closer Look</h2>
        <p>My sister, Madison Minieri, volunteered at Camp Speech Language Pathology in Motion for the summer of 2022 where she shadowed a speech pathologist. She worked with a 13-year-old boy who has cerebral palsy and dysarthria, which affects the muscles of his mouth and impairs his ability to speak. Below is a quote from Madison on how this boy used his assistive communication device to communicate:</p>
        <p>“Working with this young boy was an amazing experience. He has a tablet which includes all of the words and phrases he commonly needs, and they are programmed right into the device. These included general categories such as ‘About Me’, ‘Questions’, and ‘Places’. It also included fun categories that he loves, like his ‘Jokes’ section that he loves using to share jokes with everyone! In order to navigate the tablet, he had a scrolling button and a selection button attached to his wheelchair.”</p>
        <p>The assistive communication tablet gave this boy the ability to communicate. Speech and language are powerful and amazing forms of expression; it is incredible that technology can give people this chance. </p>
